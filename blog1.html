        <p>As I frantically hurry and try my best to finish the mark15 checklist, I am left with 2 things to do, the 1st
            one to finish styling mark14 and second one to write 2 blogs. I prioritized to write 2 blogs first, I look
            through Tanay's tweets and his own blog searching for topics and although Tanay did suggest writing a blog
            about tech and to document my journey, I chose to start writing by documenting my journey for the first
            blog. </p>
        <p>I am studying in Bapatla Engineering college, although I have just started my 3rd year of IT, truth to be
            told I don't really have a lot of knowledge in terms of coding, I do have enough knowledge, but it's no ever
            close to some of the people i have seen in the neog.camp i wasnt baffled by this, obviously they are going
            to be more knowledgeable because I did not work hard enough, I did not even work to begin with. I wanted to
            change this, i wanted to be more knowledgeable, know more stuff about coding, now i had to choose either
            between front end or back end.</p>
        <p>My math's is good but not good enough for advanced DSA and honestly front end was more interesting, so I
            wanted to try neog.camp levelZero and i started it amidst my 2nd year-end Sem exams so that I can give it
            quickly and I have never ever worked this hard or long to finish something, i have never put in consistent
            effort to work on something and never have I ever said no these many times to distractions. Whether it is
            because the course is taught by a really interesting and funny Tanay or because I have finally made up my
            mind to stop being such a dunce and do something productive, but I think it is both and either way i am here
            after 3 weeks with levelZero almost completely done, yes 3 weeks is a lot but i pat myself for this
            achievement because I have never put effort for this long into anything.</p>
        <p>More blogs to come and from here on they will be tech related, mostly.</p>
