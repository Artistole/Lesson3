        <p>Writing code is easy (kind of) but making it work efficiently and more accessible is not really that easy
            when you add more complex frameworks or fancy animations. The inspiration from this blog came to me when
            Tanay sir mentioned <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a> developed by <a
                href="https://twitter.com/thebarrytone">Barry T. Smith </a> although it has a PG-13 name, the website
            does speak truth to a great extent, and I like how he mentions we need to write code so that anyone can
            access it and not just be accessible only to people with high-speed internet or top of the notch devices.
        </p>
        <p>The Internet is not a luxury anymore, it’s a necessity. The websites we develop should work splendidly and
            still not be an eyesore to anyone although the previously mentioned website is easy to run, it is somewhat
            of an eyesore, I wanted to delve deeper into it and I came across <a href="http://txti.es/">txti.es</a>
            which can be used to build websites for free and in a easy manner.</p>
        <p>Since it was an eyesore, I wanted to explore more if websites can be built more beautifully and still be easy
            to access and this is how I came across <a
                href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com</a> which is better than
            the initially mentioned website and <a
                href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">thebestmotherfucking.website</a> is the best among them
            which is not an eye sore and looks beautiful, it even has a cute cat pic and a favicon and still works
            splendidly.</p>
        <p>Its not that the existing websites don’t run efficiently but the websites we might develop in future might
            have a lot of unnecessary animations and other stuff added to it. So, what I want you to take away from this
            blog is that if you are a web developer try to build a website which works great, looks great but also at
            the same time easy to load and make it accessible to everyone, yes google has precautions in place where it
            partially loads the website on its servers and let the rest load on the device if they are a low end device
            but that doesn’t mean we as developers shouldn’t take the responsibility to make them more accessible. </p>
        <p>Happy efficient coding :)</p>
